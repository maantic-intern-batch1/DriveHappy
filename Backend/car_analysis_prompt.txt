Analyze the provided car images in detail. Your task is to identify and describe any imperfections, repainted parts, and perfect parts. Pay close attention to each area of the car, both exterior and interior. Consider scratches, dents, rust, wear and tear, and any other visible issues.

For each part of the car:
1. Carefully examine the image(s) showing that part.
2. Note any visible damage or wear, no matter how minor.
3. If the part appears perfect, state that explicitly.
4. If you can't see a particular part clearly, indicate "Not visible in provided images" instead of "Not Available".

When estimating costs:
- Provide an approximate cost of repair in Indian Rupees for any damage found.
- Estimate the overall price of the car in Indian Rupees, considering its condition.

For tire condition:
- Estimate the remaining life of each tire as a percentage.
